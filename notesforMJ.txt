OVERVIEW

useful functions (e.g. file_exists_test ) in 
  funs_src.bash

settings and functions (eg subj_t1 ) for reward rest are in 
  sources/reward_rest

new pipeline for nim_amy is a copy of pipes/template and is in
  pipes/nim_amy


the master program (really just a script) is
  pp


to use it with our data source and pipeline, just for one person

  ONEONLY=1 ./pp reward_rest nim_amy

we can remove the "ONEONLY=1" when we are ready run on all subjects



EDITING PIPELINE

pp looks inside the pipeline script to run the functions
  run_pipeline 
  check_complete

That is, our job in making a new pipeline is to define the function
  run_pipeline 
inside our new pipeline file
  pipes/nim_amy

We can also customize check_complete to validate that run_pipeline finished correctly, 
 but the template's version is probably sufficent.


A lot of the work for writing and customizing the run_pipeline function of our pipeline is already done for us!

sources/reward_rest defines some useful functions we'll want to use.  Namely,
  subj_t1 "$id"       # returns where t1.mgz   is for subject with $id
  subj_FS_aseg "$id"  # returns where aseg.mgz is for subject with $id
  subj_t2 "$id"       # returns where the subjects epi is


The big part of what we need to do is get afni_restproc.py to run inside run_pipeline. 
We should also modify all the bash variables at the top that contain inforamation about what the pipeline does.
